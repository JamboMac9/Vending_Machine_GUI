# Vending_Machine_GUI

A solo project for University that called for a vending machine with a GUI, that enabled the use of a cash and a card customer.

The aim of this project was the OOA & OOD, not focusing 100% on the code, so there are changes that can and will be made.

A couple of improvements to be made to the code include:

* Optimise the code in CardCustomer and CashCustomer so it isn't duplicated.
* Alter CustomerDiscount code to include percentages when applying discount, rather than a set amount that changes on click.

A key element of this project for me personally, was to keep the code clean and adhere to the pillars of OOP.
